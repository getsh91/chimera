PROJECT: Project Chimera — Autonomous Influencer Network (Spec-Driven Development)

PRIME DIRECTIVE
- NEVER write or modify implementation code until you have checked the relevant files in `specs/`.
- Specs are the single source of truth. If specs are missing or ambiguous, write/adjust specs first.

WORKFLOW (MANDATORY)
1) Restate the user goal in 1-2 sentences.
2) Identify the exact spec files/sections that govern the change.
3) Propose a plan (steps + files to touch).
4) Only then write code/tests.
5) Keep changes minimal, explicit, and traceable.

ARCHITECTURAL CONSTRAINTS
- MCP-only external interaction: no direct API calls to social platforms in core logic.
- Swarm roles: Planner → Worker → Judge. Judge is the quality gate and HITL router.
- All outputs must include confidence_score + safety_tags; sensitive topics must route to HITL.

SECURITY
- Never commit secrets. Use .env.example for placeholders.
- Never log private keys, tokens, or wallet secrets.
- Prefer allowlists, schema validation, and least privilege.

TESTING & GOVERNANCE
- Tests define the “empty slots”. Prefer failing tests before implementations.
- If modifying interfaces, update schemas/contracts and tests together.
